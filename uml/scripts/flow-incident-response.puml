start

:Security event detected;
note right: From endpoint agent, network\nmonitoring, or external sources

:Event ingested by system;

:Apply initial filtering;
if (Event matches\nknown patterns?) then (noise)
    :Discard as noise;
    stop
else (potential threat)
    :Continue processing;
endif

:Correlate with existing events;
note right: Look for related events\nfrom same endpoint or user

:Apply AI/ML analysis;
note right: Anomaly detection,\nbehavior analysis, threat scoring

:Calculate threat confidence score;

if (Confidence score > 0.8?) then (high)
    :Create high-priority incident;
    :Auto-assign to senior analyst;

    fork
        :Send immediate alert;
        note right: Email, SMS, WebSocket
    fork again
        :Log to SIEM;
    fork again
        :Update dashboard;
    end fork

else (low)
    if (Confidence score > 0.5?) then (medium)
        :Create medium-priority incident;
        :Queue for analyst review;
        :Send standard alert;
    else (low)
        :Log event only;
        :No incident created;
        stop
    endif
endif

:Analyst receives alert;

:Initial triage and investigation;
fork
    :Review event timeline;
fork again
    :Check endpoint status;
fork again
    :Analyze network traffic;
fork again
    :Review user activity;
end fork

:Classify threat type;
note right: Malware, phishing, data breach,\nunauthorized access, etc.

if (False positive?) then (yes)
    :Mark as false positive;
    :Close incident;
    :Update ML model;
    stop
else (no)
    :Continue investigation;
endif

:Determine impact and scope;

if (Containment needed?) then (yes)
    fork
        :Isolate affected endpoint;
    fork again
        :Block malicious IPs;
    fork again
        :Disable compromised accounts;
    fork again
        :Quarantine files;
    end fork

    :Verify containment;
    note right: Confirm threat is isolated
endif

:Collect forensic evidence;
fork
    :Memory dump;
fork again
    :Disk imaging;
fork again
    :Network logs;
fork again
    :System logs;
end fork

:Analyze evidence;
note right: Determine attack vector,\nmalware family, data accessed

:Determine eradication steps;

if (Malware present?) then (yes)
    :Remove malware;
    :Clean infected files;
endif

if (Vulnerabilities exploited?) then (yes)
    :Apply security patches;
    :Update configurations;
endif

if (Credentials compromised?) then (yes)
    :Force password reset;
    :Revoke access tokens;
    :Enable MFA;
endif

:Begin recovery process;
fork
    :Restore from clean backups;
fork again
    :Rebuild compromised systems;
fork again
    :Restore network connectivity;
fork again
    :Re-enable user accounts;
end fork

:Verify system integrity;
note right: Ensure systems are clean\nand functioning normally

:Monitor for reinfection;
note right: Enhanced monitoring for\n24-48 hours post-recovery

if (Regulatory reporting required?) then (yes)
    :Prepare regulatory notifications;
    note right: GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS\nrequirements vary by jurisdiction

    :Submit required reports;
    note right: Within mandated timeframes
endif

if (Customer notification required?) then (yes)
    :Prepare customer communications;
    :Coordinate with legal/PR teams;
    :Send notifications;
endif

:Document lessons learned;
fork
    :Update incident response procedures;
fork again
    :Enhance detection rules;
fork again
    :Update training materials;
fork again
    :Improve security controls;
end fork

:Conduct post-incident review;
note right: Team meeting to discuss\nresponse effectiveness

:Update compliance documentation;
note right: Evidence for compliance\naudits and assessments

:Close incident;

:Generate final report;
note right: Executive summary,\ntechnical details, recommendations
