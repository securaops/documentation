  - *Impact*: Reduce operational costs by 40% and improve scalability

- **Quantum-Resistant Cryptography**: Preparation for quantum computing threats
  - *Rationale*: Current encryption will be vulnerable to quantum computers
  - *Impact*: Future-proof security architecture and maintain competitive advantage

### Advanced Analytics & Reporting
- **Executive Dashboard**: C-suite focused security and compliance dashboards
  - *Rationale*: Current dashboards are technical; executives need business-focused views
  - *Impact*: Improve executive buy-in and increase upselling opportunities

- **Regulatory Intelligence**: Automated tracking of regulatory changes
  - *Rationale*: Manual compliance tracking is error-prone; automation would ensure current compliance
  - *Impact*: Reduce compliance risk and provide competitive advantage

### Market Expansion Features
- **Industry-Specific Modules**: Tailored solutions for healthcare, finance, manufacturing
  - *Rationale*: Generic approach limits market penetration; vertical solutions would increase adoption
  - *Impact*: Expand addressable market by 50% and enable premium pricing

- **MSP/MSSP Portal**: Dedicated management portal for service providers
  - *Rationale*: Current system doesn't optimally support channel partners
  - *Impact*: Accelerate channel growth and achieve 35% of revenue through partners

## Performance & Scalability Enhancements

### Infrastructure Optimization
- **Multi-Region Deployment**: Global data center presence with regional compliance
  - *Rationale*: Current single-region deployment limits global expansion
  - *Impact*: Enable international market entry and improve performance globally

- **Advanced Caching Strategy**: Intelligent caching for improved performance
  - *Rationale*: Current caching is basic; advanced strategies would improve user experience
  - *Impact*: Reduce dashboard load times by 50% and improve user satisfaction

### Security Enhancements
- **Zero-Trust Network Extension**: Enhanced zero-trust capabilities
  - *Rationale*: Current zero-trust implementation is basic; enhanced features would improve security
  - *Impact*: Reduce security incidents by 30% and improve customer confidence

- **Advanced Threat Intelligence**: Integration with premium threat intelligence feeds
  - *Rationale*: Current threat intelligence is limited; premium feeds would improve detection
  - *Impact*: Improve threat detection accuracy by 35%

## Technology Modernization
