**Title:**
Multi-Tenant Compliance Automation Platform with Hybrid RBAC-ABAC Authorization for SaaS Environments

**Cross-Reference to Related Applications:**
N/A (if this is the first application, otherwise list prior applications)

**Field of Invention:**
The present invention relates generally to the field of software as a service (SaaS) platforms, particularly cloud-based cybersecurity and regulatory compliance automation systems. More specifically, the invention pertains to a multi-tenant architecture with hybrid role-based and attribute-based access control (RBAC-ABAC) for managing regulatory compliance, security controls, and real-time threat response in SaaS environments.

**Background:**
Modern enterprises face increasing regulatory requirements and cybersecurity threats, necessitating robust compliance automation and security management solutions. Existing compliance tools often provide limited integration with security operations, lack granular access control, and do not offer scalable multi-tenancy. Current solutions typically use either role-based access control (RBAC) or attribute-based access control (ABAC), but not a seamless hybrid model that dynamically adapts to both user roles and contextual attributes. Furthermore, prior systems do not efficiently manage tenant isolation, automated evidence collection, or real-time incident response in a unified SaaS platform.

**Summary of the Invention:**
The present invention provides a multi-tenant SaaS platform for cybersecurity and compliance automation, featuring a hybrid RBAC-ABAC authorization model. The platform comprises a modular microservices architecture, including:

- **Gateway Service:** Manages authentication, routing, and initial access control.
- **Tenant Service:** Manages tenant lifecycle, schema bootstrapping, and billing integration.
- **Auth Service:** Handles authentication, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and identity management.
- **User Service:** Manages user profiles, roles, and attributes for RBAC-ABAC.
- **Policy Decision Service:** Centralizes hybrid RBAC-ABAC policy evaluation.
- **Ingest Service:** Parses and processes logs and vulnerability feeds.
- **Threat Service:** Correlates events and manages incident response.
- **Compliance Service:** Maps controls, tracks evidence, and generates attestations.
- **Reporting Service:** Aggregates data and generates compliance reports.
- **Notification Service:** Delivers real-time notifications.
- **AI Insight Service:** Provides anomaly detection and AI-driven advisories.

The platform uses a schema-per-tenant database model for data isolation and employs a policy engine to enforce hybrid RBAC-ABAC rules. Real-time event processing, automated evidence collection, and AI-driven threat detection are integrated into a unified workflow, providing a scalable, secure, and efficient solution for managing regulatory compliance and cybersecurity in multi-tenant SaaS environments.

**Detailed Description:**
The invention is implemented as a cloud-native SaaS platform using a microservices architecture. Each service is independently deployable and scalable, communicating via REST, gRPC, and asynchronous messaging (Kafka).

**Architecture Overview:**

- **Frontend:** Built with Angular v20, Tailwind CSS, and Angular Material, providing a responsive, accessible user interface.
- **Backend:** Core services are implemented in Java with Spring Boot, using reactive programming for high concurrency. AI/ML services are implemented in Python with TensorFlow and PyTorch.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL with schema-per-tenant for data isolation. TimescaleDB for high-volume telemetry.
- **Real-Time Updates:** WebSocket and event-driven architecture for real-time notifications and incident updates.

**Key Functional Components:**

1. **Hybrid RBAC-ABAC Authorization:**
    - **User Service:** Maintains user profiles, roles, and custom attributes.
    - **Policy Decision Service:** Evaluates access requests using both role and attribute-based rules.
    - **Tenant Context:** All access decisions include tenant context for strict isolation.
2. **Automated Compliance Management:**
    - **Compliance Service:** Maps regulatory controls to evidence, tracks compliance status, and generates audit-ready reports.
    - **Evidence Collection:** Automatically collects and stores evidence for compliance controls.
3. **Real-Time Threat Detection and Incident Response:**
    - **Ingest Service:** Parses logs and vulnerability feeds, publishing events to Kafka.
    - **Threat Service:** Correlates events, detects incidents, and triggers automated or manual responses.
4. **AI-Driven Insights:**
    - **AI Insight Service:** Uses machine learning models for anomaly detection and provides GPT-based advisories.
5. **Multi-Tenancy and Scalability:**
    - **Tenant Service:** Manages tenant lifecycle and schema bootstrapping.
    - **Schema-Per-Tenant:** Ensures data isolation and security.

**Technical Novelty:**
The invention introduces a novel hybrid RBAC-ABAC authorization model for multi-tenant SaaS environments, enabling fine-grained, context-aware access control. The integration of automated compliance management, real-time threat detection, and AI-driven insights within a unified platform is not found in prior art. The use of schema-per-tenant databases, event-driven architecture, and modular microservices provides scalability, security, and operational efficiency.

**Drawings:**
(Include architectural diagrams, flowcharts, and component diagrams illustrating the system architecture, data flow, and authorization process.)
