Multi-Tenant Compliance Automation Platform with Hybrid RBAC-ABAC Authorization for SaaS Environments

**Cross-Reference to Related Applications:**
N/A (if this is the first application, otherwise list prior applications)

**Field of Invention:**
The present invention relates generally to the field of software as a service (SaaS) platforms, particularly cloud-based cybersecurity and regulatory compliance automation systems. More specifically, the invention pertains to a multi-tenant architecture with hybrid role-based and attribute-based access control (RBAC-ABAC) for managing regulatory compliance, security controls, and real-time threat response in SaaS environments.

**Background:**
Modern enterprises face escalating cybersecurity threats and increasingly stringent regulatory compliance requirements. These challenges are complex and resource-intensive to manage, especially for organizations that rely on manual, fragmented compliance processes. Many companies utilize spreadsheets, document management systems, and manual workflows to track compliance, which often leads to inefficiencies, errors, and audit failures. Without automated, real-time threat monitoring, security incidents may go undetected or are addressed too late, increasing risk exposure. Furthermore, security and compliance teams often operate in silos, resulting in disjointed workflows and delayed responses to incidents. Small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) are particularly vulnerable, as they typically lack dedicated cybersecurity teams and cannot afford expensive, complex solutions. Existing access control models are often limited, failing to provide fine-grained, context-aware permissions that are essential for secure, multi-tenant SaaS environments.

Current cybersecurity and compliance automation products exhibit several critical shortcomings. Most solutions focus either on compliance management or security operations, but rarely integrate both seamlessly, leading to fragmented workflows and reduced operational efficiency. Access control is commonly limited to basic role-based models, with few implementations of attribute-based or hybrid RBAC-ABAC models, thus restricting the ability to enforce fine-grained, context-aware permissions. Multi-tenancy is often handled with coarse isolation, which can lead to data leakage and operational inefficiencies. Real-time threat detection and automated incident response are usually limited or absent in many platforms, and the integration of AI and machine learning for predictive analytics and anomaly detection is underutilized. Additionally, many products target large enterprises with complex deployments, making them in accessible or impractical for SMBs due to high costs and steep learning curves.

**Summary of the Invention:**
The present invention addresses these critical gaps by providing a unified, multi-tenant SaaS platform that integrates compliance automation with real-time security operations. The platform unifies compliance management and security operations into a single, cohesive workflow, eliminating silos and streamlining processes. It implements a hybrid RBAC-ABAC authorization model for fine-grained, context-aware permissions within each tenant, ensuring robust security and strict tenant isolation.

The invention leverages reactive microservices and event-driven architecture to provide real-time threat detection and automated incident response. It integrates AI and machine learning capabilities for predictive analytics, anomaly detection, and GPT-based advisory services, enhancing a proactive security posture and informed decision-making. The platform employs a schema-per-tenant database design to ensure strict data isolation and operational efficiency for multi-tenant environments.

Designed with SMBs in mind, the platform offers a cost-effective, user-friendly interface built with modern web technologies (Angular, Tailwind CSS), reducing complexity and enabling rapid adoption. The invention is scalable and accessible, combining advanced security, compliance automation, and AI-driven insights to fill critical market gaps and provide a comprehensive solution for enterprises of all sizes.

- **Real-Time Updates:** Utilizes a WebSocket and event-driven architecture for delivering real-time notifications and incident updates.

**Key Functional Components:**

1. **Hybrid RBAC-ABAC Authorization:**
    - **User Service:** Maintains user profiles, roles, and custom attributes.
    - **Policy Decision Service:** Evaluates access requests using both role and attribute-based rules.
    - **Tenant Context:** All access decisions include tenant context for strict isolation.
2. **Automated Compliance Management:**
    - **Compliance Service:** Maps regulatory controls to evidence, tracks compliance status, and generates audit-ready reports.
